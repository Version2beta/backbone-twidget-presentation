backbone-twitter-demo
=====================

This is a presentation using my backbone-twidget Twitter search widget written with Backbone.js. We broke it into "steps" or "stages" 1 through 12 using git tags to facilitate presenting the code in an easy-to-follow way. At least that was the plan.

@Arlen (paladin on GitHub) and I presented June 14, 2012 and it seemed to be well received.

Not that it matters much, but I changed the name of this repository on June 15, 2012
